    "Over the past year, New York has seen more than its fair share of media coverage when it comes to police brutality. While our city is certainly no stranger to such heinous and often deadly behavior, the past few months have shown that it is occurring more frequently than many would care to admit. Average law-abiding citizens are being unfairly targeted, while hard working honest cops are blamed for the terrible behavior of a certain few. If you, or a family member, have recently been physically, emotionally or mentally abused by a police officer, you may have grounds to pursue legal action.",
